# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m David

Cool that just you found my repository!

## :open_book: About
 
  I'm a web developer with 6 years in the game from Stockholm Sweden :sweden: with a big passion for building smart, efficient and long-lasting code.  
  <br>
  I mostly prefer to code in JavaScript both for Front End and Back End. But I'm always looking for new techniques that suits me or the current project even more.

## :technologist: Professional Experience

  I'm currently working as a system developer at HiQ Sweden, where I'm working as a consultant with web development focus, for the moment working with one of Swedens largest E-commerce sites as a Front End Developer. With a wide variation of techniques e.g. React.js, TypeScript, Next.js, Material UI.  
  <br>
  Always interest in new exiting opportunities not just in Sweden but abroad or remote too! :earth_africa:  

## :owl: Interest

I'm a developer who likes to have one feet in each end so to speak. :foot:  
<br>
I do prefer to build durable code with high performance and complex logical calculations.  :gear:  
But I also really like the more UI based way of coding, working with animations and styles.   :art:  
These to combined is what I really thinks makes a great product.

I do like to exprience with new types of techniques and always striving to become a better programmer than I was yesterday.  

I'm currently looking into combining SPA-applications with static generated sites e.g. Next.js, Gatsby.js

Looking into better ways to work with SVG-animations and ThemeUI for faster styling of components.
